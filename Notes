Embeddings
========================

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings

OpenAI’s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:

Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)
An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.

Visit our pricing page to learn about embeddings pricing.
Requests are billed based on the number of tokens in the input.

To get an embedding, send your text string to the embeddings API endpoint
along with the embedding model name (e.g., text-embedding-3-small):

----------------------------------------------

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.embeddings.create(
    input="Your text string goes here",
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)

print(response.data[0].embedding)

----------------------------------------------

The response contains the embedding vector (list of floating point numbers)
along with some additional metadata.

You can extract the embedding vector, save it in a vector database,
and use for many different use cases.

{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "index": 0,
      "embedding": [
        -0.006929283495992422,
        -0.005336422007530928,
        -4.547132266452536e-05,
        -0.024047505110502243
      ],
    }
  ],
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 5,
    "total_tokens": 5
  }
}

By default, the length of the embedding vector is 1536 for text-embedding-3-small or
3072 for text-embedding-3-large.

To reduce the embedding's dimensions without losing its concept-representing properties,
pass in the dimensions parameter. Find more detail on embedding dimensions in the
embedding use case section.

Embedding models:
==============================

OpenAI offers two powerful third-generation embedding model (denoted by -3 in the model ID).

Usage is priced per input token. Below is an example of pricing pages of text per US dollar (assuming ~800 tokens per page):

Model	                    ~ Pages per dollar	Performance on MTEB eval	Max input
text-embedding-3-small	   62,500	            62.3%	                    8192
text-embedding-3-large	   9,615	            64.6%	                    8192
text-embedding-ada-002	   12,500	            61.0%	                    8192


==============================
Tokenizer:
==============================

https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer

==============================


OpenAI's large language models process text using tokens, which are common sequences of characters
found in a set of text.

The models learn to understand the statistical relationships between these tokens,
and excel at producing the next token in a sequence of tokens.

As a rule of thumb, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words for English text.


=====================
in the spring-ai application, once you start it, it stores the pdf content into vector store by creating embeddings.

The embeddings are stored in file vector_store.json.

The example is :

http://localhost:8080/ics?q=explain%20law%20on%20child%20labour

Response:

Child labor laws are designed to protect the rights of children and prevent them from being exploited in the workforce. These laws typically set a minimum age for employment, restrict the number of hours a child can work, and outline the types of hazardous work that are prohibited for children. In most countries, children under a certain age (usually around 14-16 years old) are prohibited from working in order to ensure they have the opportunity to receive an education and develop physically and emotionally. Additionally, child labor laws often require employers to obtain work permits for minors and to provide a safe and healthy work environment for young workers. Employers who violate child labor laws can face fines, legal action, and even imprisonment. It is important for parents, educators, and government officials to be aware of and enforce these laws in order to protect the rights and well-being of children in the workforce.

Response:
Child labour is defined and regulated by various laws in India. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in hazardous occupations. The Act also regulates the conditions of work for children between the ages of 14 and 18. Additionally, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2015 provides for the care, protection, treatment, development, and rehabilitation of children in need of care and protection, including those involved in child labour.
